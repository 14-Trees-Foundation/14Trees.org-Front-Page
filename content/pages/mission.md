## Transform Barren Lands into Sustainable Green Forests

A human being, during her lifetime breathes a lot of air. And 14 trees in their lifetime can generate as much Oxygen as a human being requires during her lifetime.
 
So if you plant 14 trees, you are virtually able to give back to the environment the oxygen you have or are going to use up. So what does this mean? There is enough land available. There are enough saplings available. All you need is intent, a little bit of money, to get your 14 Trees going.

##### Make your life Oxygen-Neutral. And leave a better world for our children and promise them a better future. Are you Oxy-Neutral yet?
