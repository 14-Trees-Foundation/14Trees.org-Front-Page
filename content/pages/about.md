## 14 Trees Foundation is a charitable organization dedicated to building sustainable, carbon-footprint-neutral eco-systems through re-forestation


I am a technology entrepreneur and a Computer
Science graduate from IIT Kanpur. I am taking
some time off from my professional life to start a
non-profit social enterprise on reforestation.
We are bringing
- nature enthusiasts,
- gram panchayat members,
- barren land-owners &
- tribal workers
together in service of
transforming barren land
into sustainable forests.
We have already made a
small beginning with 75
acres of barren land near
Pune. Nature lovers all
over the world are invited
to contribute their ideas,
energy and resources to
help us grow this
initiative.
